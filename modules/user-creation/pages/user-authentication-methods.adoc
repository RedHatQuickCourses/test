== User Authentication Methods

User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system before granting access to resources. It is a critical component of access management, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access sensitive data and systems. This section will cover various user authentication methods, their strengths, and weaknesses.

**1. Password-based Authentication**

Password-based authentication is the most common method, where users provide a username and a secret password to gain access.

* **Strengths:**
  - Simple to implement and understand.
  - No additional hardware or software required.

* **Weaknesses:**
  - Users often choose weak or easily guessable passwords.
  - Passwords can be stolen through phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks.

* **Best Practices:**
  - Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, and regular changes).
  - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.

**2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

MFA requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. These factors typically fall into three categories:

* **Something the user knows** (password, PIN)
* **Something the user has** (security token, smartphone)
* **Something the user is** (biometrics, fingerprint)

* **Strengths:**
  - Significantly improves security by requiring multiple forms of verification.
  - Reduces the risk of compromised credentials.

* **Weaknesses:**
  - Can be more complex for users to manage.
  - Additional costs for hardware or software tokens.

**3. Biometric Authentication**

Biometric authentication uses unique biological characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, to verify identity.

* **Strengths:**
  - Highly secure, as biometric traits are unique to each individual.
  - No need to remember passwords or carry additional tokens.

* **Weaknesses:**
  - Privacy concerns regarding the storage and use of biometric data.
  - Potential for false negatives or positives.

**4. Token-based Authentication**

Token-based authentication involves the use of physical or software tokens that generate one-time passwords (OTP) or nonces.

* **Strengths:**
  - Provides
