#  User Creation

**User Creation**

User Creation involves the process of establishing user accounts within a system. This includes understanding user account management, which encompasses creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts as needed. Authentication methods, such as passwords, biometrics, or multi-factor authentication, are also crucial for verifying user identities. Effective user creation ensures secure access control and maintains system integrity. It requires adherence to principles of least privilege, granting users the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their job functions. Regular review and update of user accounts are essential to prevent unauthorized access and maintain security.
